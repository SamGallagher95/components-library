# Components Library

## Quick Start

To use this project you need to setup a project in typescript and use browserify to transpile to javascript. Explaining how to do this is outside of the scope of this project but https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/gulp.html is a good place to start.

Before anything you will want to instantiate and App class.

```
import { App } from './components-library/base/app';

const app = new App();
```

It's that easy!
